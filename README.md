# IARA
Indoor Airborne Risk Assessment

---

IARA is a web-based application that calculates the risk of airborne disease transmission using both the traditional Wells-Riley model and an enhanced Wells-Riley model that captures the residual risk after the infectious individuals leave the indoor environment.

Designed for public health officials, building managers, and all types of people looking to make informed decisions about how to setup and manage their space in a way that mitigates infection risk.
